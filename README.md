#California-Housing-Prices-Prediction

California Housing Prices Prediction involves leveraging machine learning to forecast the median house value in California districts based on diverse features such as median income, housing age, room and bedroom averages, population, and households. The process includes exploring the dataset, preprocessing data by handling missing values and encoding features, performing feature engineering, splitting the data into training and testing sets, choosing a suitable regression model, training the model, tuning hyperparameters for optimal performance, evaluating the model, interpreting results, and potentially deploying the model for predicting housing prices in new data. You can find a relevant dataset for this task on Kaggle: California Housing Prices Dataset. The objective is to develop an accurate and generalizable model for estimating housing prices based on various factors.
